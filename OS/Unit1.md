# What is an Operating System (OS)?

An **Operating System (OS)** is the main software that manages all the hardware and other software on a computer. It acts as a bridge between the user, system applications, and the computer hardware. The OS makes sure everything works together smoothly, allowing us to run programs, save files, and use devices like printers and keyboards.

## Structure of Operating System

The structure of an OS refers to how its different parts are organized and how they interact. There are several ways to design an OS, but here are two common structures explained simply:

### 1. Simple Structure

A **simple structure** OS is built as one large program where all the basic functions (like process management, memory management, and file handling) are mixed together. There is little separation between different parts, making it easy to build but harder to maintain or update.

- Early versions of **MS-DOS** used a simple structure.
- All the code for handling files, devices, and user commands was combined into one large program.
- There was little separation between different functions.
- Changing one part of the system could easily affect other parts, making maintenance difficult.
- This design made the OS easy to build initially but hard to update or expand later.

**Analogy:**  
Think of a simple structure like a one-room house where everything (kitchen, bedroom, living room) is in the same space. Itâ€™s easy to build, but if you want to change the kitchen, you might disturb the bedroom!

---

### 2. Layered Structure

A **layered structure** OS is organized into layers, each built on top of the one below it. Each layer has a specific job and only interacts with the layers directly above or below it. This makes the OS easier to understand, test, and update.

- The **UNIX operating system** uses a layered approach:
  - The **lowest layer** interacts directly with the hardware.
  - The **middle layer** manages basic OS functions such as process and memory management.
  - The **top layer** provides user services and interfaces, like the shell and system utilities.
- This separation into layers makes UNIX easier to maintain, update, and understand.
- Each layer only interacts with the layers directly above and below it, improving system reliability and modularity.
- Example: If you update a user service, you usually don't need to change the hardware interaction layer.

**Analogy:**  
Imagine a layered structure like a multi-story building. Each floor has a different purpose (parking, offices, apartments), and you can work on one floor without affecting the others.

**Summary Table:**

| Structure         | Description                                     | Example | Analogy              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| Simple Structure  | All functions mixed together in one big program | MS-DOS  | One-room house       |
| Layered Structure | Organized in layers, each with a specific job   | UNIX    | Multi-story building |

## OS Services

An operating system (OS) provides many important services to make the computer work smoothly and safely. Here are 8 key OS services explained in simple English:

1. **Program Execution**  
   The OS helps you run programs and applications. It loads them into memory, starts them, and manages their execution.

2. **I/O Operations**  
   The OS manages input and output devices like keyboards, mouse, printers, and screens. It helps programs read from and write to these devices easily.

3. **File System Manipulation**  
   The OS lets you create, delete, read, write, and organize files and folders on your computer.

4. **Communication Services**  
   The OS allows programs and users to communicate with each other, either on the same computer or over a network.

5. **Error Detection and Handling**  
   The OS checks for errors in hardware and software. If something goes wrong, it reports the problem and may try to fix it.

6. **Resource Allocation**  
   The OS decides how to share resources like CPU time, memory, and devices among different programs and users.

7. **Security and Protection**  
   The OS protects your data and programs from unauthorized access. It uses passwords, permissions, and other security measures.

8. **User Interface**  
   The OS provides ways for you to interact with the computer, such as command-line interfaces (CLI) or graphical user interfaces (GUI).

---

**Example:**

- Windows, Linux, and macOS are platforms that allow you to run applications like browsers, games, and office tools.

### **Important Functions of an Operating System**

An **Operating System (OS)** is like the manager of a computer. It controls everything happening inside the computer and makes sure everything works smoothly. Below are its important functions:

---

### **1. Memory Management**

- Memory (RAM) is like a workspace where programs run.
- The OS decides which program gets how much memory and keeps track of free space.
- It ensures that one program doesnâ€™t take memory from another.
- It also moves programs between RAM and storage (like a hard drive) when needed.

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** When you open a game and a web browser at the same time, the OS manages memory so both can work properly without crashing.

---

### **2. Processor Management (CPU Management)**

- The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is like the brain of the computer.
- The OS decides which program or task should use the CPU and for how long.
- If many programs are running, the OS quickly switches between them so they all work smoothly.
- This is called **multitasking**.

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** If you're watching a video while typing in a document, the OS makes sure both tasks share the CPU efficiently.

---

### **3. Device Management**

- A computer has many devices like a keyboard, mouse, printer, USB drives, etc.
- The OS acts as a bridge between these devices and the computer.
- It helps the devices send and receive data properly.
- The OS uses special programs called **drivers** to help devices communicate.

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** When you plug in a printer, the OS helps the computer understand how to use it.

---

### **4. File Management**

- A computer stores data in files and folders.
- The OS organizes, saves, opens, renames, and deletes files.
- It keeps track of where files are stored on the hard drive or SSD.
- It also manages file permissions (who can open or edit a file).

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** When you save a Word document or a photo, the OS keeps it safe and allows you to find it later.

---

### **5. Security**

- The OS protects the computer from **unauthorized access** and **viruses**.
- It allows users to set **passwords**, **permissions**, and **firewalls** to keep data safe.
- It also protects against **hackers** and **malware**.

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** When you log in to your computer with a password, the OS ensures that only you can access your files.

---

### **6. Control Over System Performance**

- The OS checks how well the computer is working.
- It monitors the **CPU, memory, and other resources** to make sure they are not overloaded.
- If something is slowing down the system, the OS tries to fix it.

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** If a program is using too much memory and slowing down the computer, the OS may close it or give a warning.

---

### **7. Job Accounting**

- The OS keeps a record of what programs and users are using the system.
- This is useful in large businesses where many people share one computer.
- It helps track resource usage for **billing** and **management purposes**.

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** In an office, the OS records which employees used the printer and how many pages they printed.

---

### **8. Error Detecting Aids**

- The OS constantly checks for errors in the system.
- If there is a problem (like a **corrupt file** or **hardware failure**), the OS alerts the user.
- It may also try to fix small issues automatically.

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** If your hard drive has a problem, the OS may show a warning and suggest fixing it.

---

### **9. Coordination Between Other Software and Users**

- The OS makes sure that all programs, users, and devices work together properly.
- It helps different software talk to each other.
- It allows **multiple users** to use the same computer at different times.

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** If you are downloading a file while listening to music, the OS ensures both work smoothly without stopping.

### 1. Batch Operating System

**Definition:** Batch operating systems execute batches of jobs without user interaction. Users prepare their tasks offline and submit them to the computer operator, who groups similar tasks into batches for processing.

**Key Features:**

- **Job Scheduling:** Groups similar jobs to optimize processing.
- **No Immediate User Interaction:** Users cannot interact with their programs during execution.
- **Efficient for Repetitive Tasks:** Ideal for tasks that require similar processing.

**Example:** Early IBM mainframe systems used batch processing for tasks like payroll and inventory management.

### Spooling

#### Simultaneous Peripheral Operations Online

1. In a computer system, input-output devices such as printers are very slow relative to the performance of the rest of the system.

2. Spooling is a process in which data is temporarily held in memory or other volatile storage to be used by a device or a program.

3. Data from a card reader is first stored in memory (or disk), and then sent to the printer when it is ready to process the data. This allows the CPU and other components to continue working without waiting for the slow device to finish.

4. The most common implementation of spooling can be found in typical input/output devices such as the keyboard, mouse and printer. For example, in printer spooling, the documents/files that are sent to the printer are first stored in the memory. Once the printer is ready, it fetches the data and prints it.

---

### 2. Multiprogramming Operating System

**Definition:** Multiprogramming operating systems allow multiple programs to reside in memory simultaneously, managing their execution to optimize CPU usage.

**Key Features:**

- **Increased Throughput:** Maximizes CPU utilization by reducing idle time.
- **Efficient Memory Management:** Allocates memory to multiple programs effectively.
- **Job Scheduling:** Determines the order in which programs execute based on priority and resource availability.

* **Multiple Jobs:** Keeps several jobs in main memory simultaneously, allowing more efficient utilization of the CPU.

* **Job Execution:** The OS picks and begins to execute one of the jobs in memory.

* **Waiting Jobs:** Eventually, a job may need to wait for a task, such as an I/O operation, to complete.

### 3. Time-Sharing Operating System

**Definition:** Time-sharing operating systems allow multiple users to use a computer system simultaneously by rapidly switching between tasks, giving the impression that each user has their own dedicated system.

**Key Features:**

- **Multitasking:** Runs multiple tasks by allocating time slices to each.
- **User Interaction:** Users can interact with their programs during execution.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Maximizes CPU usage by reducing idle time.

**Example:** UNIX is a classic example of a time-sharing operating system.

**Multitasking Operating system/time sharing/Multiprogramming with Round Robin/ Fair Share**

1. **Time sharing** (or multitasking) is a logical extension of **multiprogramming**, it allows many users to share the computer simultaneously. The CPU executes multiple jobs (**May belong to** different user) **by switching among** them, but the switches occur so frequently that, each user is given the impression that the **entire computer system** is dedicated to **his/her** use, even though it is being **shared among many** users.

2. In the modern operating systems, we are able to play **MP3 music**, edit documents in Microsoft Word, surf the Google Chrome all running at the same time. (**by context switching, the illusion of parallelism is achieved**)

3. For multitasking to take place, firstly there should be multiprogramming i.e. presence of multiple programs ready for execution. And secondly the concept of time sharing.

4. These OS use time quantum is a core component of time-sharing operating systems, as it enables CPU time to be divided fairly among multiple users or processes through rapid context switching.

**Image:**

### 4. Multiprocessing Operating System / tightly coupled system

1. **Multiprocessor Operating System** refers to the use of two or more central processing units (CPU) within a single computer system. These multiple CPU's share system bus, **memory and other peripheral devices**.

2. Multiple concurrent processes each can run on a separate CPU, here we achieve a true parallel execution of processes.

3. Becomes most important in computer system, where the complexity of the job is more, and CPU divides and conquers the jobs. Generally used in the fields like artificial intelligence and expert system, image processing, weather forecasting etc.

### **What is the Kernel?**

The **kernel** is the core component of an operating system. It acts as a bridge between the hardware and software, managing system resources and enabling communication between applications and the hardware. The kernel is responsible for critical tasks such as process management, memory management, device management, and system security.

#### Key Responsibilities:

1. **Resource Management:** Allocates CPU, memory, and I/O devices to processes.
2. **Process Management:** Handles process creation, scheduling, and termination.
3. **Memory Management:** Manages RAM allocation and virtual memory.
4. **Device Management:** Facilitates communication between hardware devices and software.
5. **System Security:** Ensures secure access to system resources.

---

### **Types of Kernels**

#### 1. **Microkernel**

- **Definition:** A microkernel is a minimalistic kernel that includes only essential functions like inter-process communication and basic hardware management. Other services, such as file systems and device drivers, run in user space.
- **Reason for Use:** Microkernels are designed for modularity and reliability. By isolating services in user space, they reduce the risk of system crashes caused by kernel bugs.
- **Analogy:** Imagine a small control room that delegates tasks to specialized departments (user space services). If one department fails, the control room remains unaffected.

#### 2. **Monolithic Kernel**

- **Definition:** A monolithic kernel integrates all operating system services, including device drivers, file systems, and memory management, into a single large block of code running in kernel space.
- **Reason for Use:** Monolithic kernels prioritize performance by allowing direct communication between components without the overhead of context switching.
- **Analogy:** Think of a single, large factory where all departments work in the same open space. While efficient, a problem in one department can disrupt the entire factory.

#### 3. **Reentrant Kernel**

- **Definition:** A reentrant kernel allows multiple processes to execute the same kernel code simultaneously by ensuring that the code is non-modifiable and uses separate data for each process.
- **Reason for Use:** Reentrant kernels are essential for multitasking and concurrency, as they prevent processes from interfering with each other.
- **Analogy:** Picture a library where multiple people can read the same book (kernel code) at the same time, but each person uses their own notebook (process data) to take notes.

### **Comparison of Kernel Types**

| **Feature**     | **Microkernel**                                          | **Monolithic Kernel**                       | **Reentrant Kernel**                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Modularity**  | Highly modular, services run in user space.              | Less modular, all services in kernel space. | Shared kernel code with separate data.   |
| **Performance** | Slower due to user-kernel communication.                 | Faster due to direct communication.         | Efficient for multitasking.              |
| **Stability**   | More stable, as bugs in services don't crash the kernel. | Less stable, as bugs can crash the system.  | Stable due to isolated process data.     |
| **Complexity**  | More complex to implement.                               | Simpler to implement.                       | Requires careful design for concurrency. |

---

### **Conclusion**

The choice of kernel type depends on the system's requirements. Microkernels are ideal for reliability and modularity, monolithic kernels excel in performance, and reentrant kernels are crucial for multitasking and concurrency. Each type has its strengths and trade-offs, making them suitable for different use cases.

## Microkernel Systems

- In the mid-1980s, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University developed an operating system called **Mach** that modularized the kernel using the **microkernel** approach.

- This method structures the operating system by removing all nonessential components from the kernel and implementing them as system and **user-level programs**. The result is a small kernel.

- One benefit of the microkernel approach is that it makes extending the operating system easier. All new services are added to user space and consequently do not require modification of the kernel.

- When the kernel does have to be modified, the changes tend to be fewer, because the microkernel is a smaller kernel.

- The **MINIX 3 microkernel**, for example, has only approximately **12,000 lines of code**. Developer **Andrew S. Tanenbaum**.

### Reentrant Kernels

A **reentrant kernel** is a type of operating system kernel that allows multiple processes to share the same kernel code simultaneously. This is achieved by ensuring that the kernel code does not modify itself and uses separate data for each process.

#### Key Features:

1. **Code Sharing:** The kernel code is shared among processes, reducing memory usage.
2. **Separate Data:** Each process has its own data, ensuring no interference between processes.
3. **Concurrency:** Multiple processes can execute kernel functions at the same time without conflicts.

#### Benefits:

- **Efficiency:** Saves memory by sharing code.
- **Scalability:** Supports multiple processes effectively.
- **Stability:** Prevents processes from interfering with each other.

#### Example:

Modern operating systems like Linux and Windows use reentrant kernels to handle multitasking efficiently.

#### Analogy:

Think of a reentrant kernel as a library where multiple people can read the same book (code) at the same time, but each person uses their own notebook (data) to take notes.

### Monolithic Kernel

A **monolithic kernel** is a type of operating system architecture where the entire operating system, including the core services like process management, memory management, file system management, and device drivers, runs in a single address space in kernel mode.

#### Key Features:

1. **Single Address Space:** All components of the OS operate in the same memory space, which allows for faster communication between them.
2. **High Performance:** Since there is no overhead of context switching between kernel components, monolithic kernels are generally faster.
3. **Tightly Coupled Components:** All functionalities are integrated into one large block of code, making it less modular.

#### Benefits:

- **Efficiency:** Direct communication between components leads to better performance.
- **Simplicity:** Easier to implement compared to microkernels.

#### Drawbacks:

- **Stability Issues:** A bug in one component can crash the entire system.
- **Difficult Maintenance:** Modifying or updating one part of the kernel can affect the entire system.

#### Example:

Operating systems like **Linux**, **Windows NT**, and early versions of **UNIX** use monolithic kernels.

#### Analogy:

Think of a monolithic kernel as a single, large factory where all departments (e.g., production, packaging, shipping) work in the same building without walls separating them. While this setup allows for quick communication, a problem in one department can disrupt the entire factory.

## System Calls and Application Programming Interface (API)

### Purpose

**System calls** and **APIs** are the ways programs interact with the operating system. They act as a bridge between user applications and the OS, allowing programs to request services like reading files, creating processes, or communicating with devices. Without system calls, applications would not be able to use hardware or manage resources safely and efficiently.

- **System Calls:** Special functions provided by the OS that let programs ask the OS to perform tasks on their behalf.
- **APIs:** Sets of functions and protocols that make it easier for programmers to use system calls without dealing with low-level details.

### Five Common System Calls

#### 1. `fork()`

- **Purpose:** Creates a new process by duplicating the current process.
- **Simple Explanation:** It's like making a copy of a running program so both can work independently.
- **Example Use:** When you open a new tab in a terminal, the OS uses `fork()` to create a new shell process.

#### 2. `exec()`

- **Purpose:** Replaces the current process with a new program.
- **Simple Explanation:** Think of it as switching the program running in a process without changing the process itself.
- **Example Use:** After `fork()`, a child process often uses `exec()` to run a different program.

#### 3. `wait()`

- **Purpose:** Makes a process pause until one of its child processes finishes.
- **Simple Explanation:** Like a parent waiting for its child to finish a task before continuing.
- **Example Use:** A shell waits for a command to finish before showing the prompt again.

#### 4. `open()`

- **Purpose:** Opens a file so it can be read or written.
- **Simple Explanation:** Tells the OS you want to use a file, and the OS gives you a handle to work with it.
- **Example Use:** When you open a document in an editor, the program uses `open()` to access the file.

#### 5. `read()` and `write()`

- **Purpose:** `read()` gets data from a file, and `write()` puts data into a file.
- **Simple Explanation:** Like reading from or writing to a notebook.
- **Example Use:** When saving a file, the editor uses `write()`; when loading, it uses `read()`.

---

**Summary Table:**

| System Call        | Category           | What It Does (Simple)                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `fork()`           | Process Management | Makes a copy of a running program         |
| `exec()`           | Process Management | Runs a new program in the current process |
| `wait()`           | Process Management | Waits for a child process to finish       |
| `open()`           | File Management    | Opens a file for reading or writing       |
| `read()`/`write()` | File Management    | Reads from or writes to a file            |

System calls make it possible for programs to use the power of the operating system in a safe and controlled way.
