1. Differentiate between paging and segmentation.
2. Define Paging and Segmentation
3. Define Paging scheme with an example in detail.

4. What is Virtual Memory? How is it implemented?
5. Consider a machine with 64 MB physical memory and a 32-bit virtual address space. If the page size is 4KB, what is the approximate size of the page table?
6. Consider a machine with 64 MB physical memory and a 32-bit virtual address space. If the page size is 4KB, what is the approximate size of the page table?
7. Explain the concept of segmentation with proper diagram.
8. Five memory partitions of 100, 500, 200, 300 & 600 (all in KB) are in order, how would the ‘first-fit, best-fit & worst-fit’ shall place processes of size 212, 417, 112, & 426 ((all in KB). Deduce the most efficient memory management technique
9. Discuss the following storage placement strategies with suitable examples : (i) Best fit (ii) First fit (iii) Worst fit
10. Illustrate the following page-replacement algorithms.
    i) FIFO
    ii) LRU
    Use the reference string 7, 0,1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2,1, 2, 0, 1, 7, 0,1 for a memory with four frames
11. Calculate the number of page faults that would occur in case of optimal page replacement algorithm for the following reference string? Assuming the demand paging technique is used by OS 2,3,4,3,4,1,6,7,8,7,1,8,9,8,9,5,4,2,1
12. Consider the following page reference string : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 3 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 4 , 5 , 2 , 6. Calculate number of page faults using LRU and OPTIMAL Page replacement algorithm. Assume number of frames as three
13. Discuss Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)? Find how many cycles’ deadlocks reside in given figure.
14. what is a Resource allocation Graph
15. Define graceful degradation?
16. Suppose we have five processes and three resources, A, B, and C. A has 10 instances, B has 5 instances and C has 7 instances. Can the system execute the following processes without deadlock occurring, if yes find safe sequence? Process Allocation Maximum A B C A B C P1 0 1 0 7 5 3 P2 2 0 0 3 2 2 P3 3 0 2 9 0 2 P4 2 1 1 2 2 2 P5 0 0 2 4 3 3
