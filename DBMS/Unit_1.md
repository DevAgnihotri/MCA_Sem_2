### 1. **Data**

**2022‚Äì23 Q1:** Define the terms "Data" and "Database".

**Definition:**  
Data is raw facts and figures that have no meaning on their own.

**Example:**  
`85`, `John`, `Math`, `2025-04-11` ‚Äî These are just individual pieces of data.

---

### 2. **Information**

**Definition:**  
Information is processed data that has meaning and is useful for decision-making.

**Example:**  
`John scored 85 marks in the Math exam on 2025-04-11.` ‚Äî This gives meaningful insight using raw data.

---

### 3. **Database**

**2022‚Äì23 Q1:** Define the terms "Data" and "Database".

**Definition:**  
A database is an organized collection of related information stored electronically for easy access and management.

**Example:**  
A table storing students' names, roll numbers, marks, and subjects is a database.

| Roll No | Name | Subject | Marks |
| ------- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| 101     | John | Math    | 85    |
| 102     | Asha | Science | 90    |

---

### 4. **DBMS (Database Management System)**

**2016‚Äì17 Q1:** What are the disadvantages of database systems?

- **High cost:** Purchasing, licensing, and maintaining a DBMS can be expensive.  
- **Complexity:** Designing, installing, and managing a database requires specialized skills.  
- **Performance overhead:** For simple tasks, a full-featured DBMS may be slower than lightweight solutions.  
- **Security risk:** Centralizing data makes it a more attractive target for attacks.  
- **Single point of failure:** If the DBMS goes down, all dependent applications may stop working.  
- **Maintenance:** Regular backups, tuning, and upgrades are necessary to keep the system running smoothly.  

**Definition:**  
A DBMS is software that helps to create, manage, and use databases efficiently.

**Example:**  
MySQL, Oracle, MS Access, and PostgreSQL are examples of DBMS software.

---

### ‚ú¶ Relationship Paragraph:

Data is the basic building block, which when processed becomes information. A **database** stores this data in an organized way, making it easy to manage. A **DBMS** is the software that allows users to interact with the database‚Äîsuch as inserting, updating, deleting, or retrieving data. Together, they help in storing and processing data to get meaningful information for various applications, like managing student records, banking systems, and more.

### üìÇ What is a File Processing System (FPS)?

A **File Processing System** is a way of storing and managing data using **separate files** for each task or program. Each file is managed by a different program, and there is **no central control** over the data.

> üî∏ **Example**: In a college, there may be different files for student data, fee records, exam results, and library data. Each department manages its own file.

---

### üóÑÔ∏è What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?

A **Database Management System** is software that stores and manages all the data in **a single system**. It provides tools to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data, along with **security, consistency, and easy access**.

> üî∏ **Example**: In a DBMS, all student details (name, roll no, fees, results) are stored in a single database, and multiple users can access it based on permission.

---

## üìÅ **File System** vs üíæ **Database System (DBMS)**

| **File System**                                        | **Database System (DBMS)**                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Stores data in separate files manually.                | Stores data in a structured, organized way.                  |
| Data redundancy is **high** (duplicate data).          | Data redundancy is **low** due to normalization.             |
| Data consistency is **difficult** to maintain.         | Ensures **better consistency** of data.                      |
| No built-in security features.                         | Offers **built-in security and access control**.             |
| **Difficult** to search, update, or manage large data. | **Easy** to search, update, and manage large data.           |
| No support for multi-user access or concurrent use.    | **Supports** multiple users and concurrent access.           |
| No backup and recovery system.                         | **Automatic** backup and recovery features available.        |
| Data relationships are **hard to manage**.             | **Efficiently manages** relationships using keys and tables. |

### Why Use DBMS Instead of FPS?\*\*

- File systems are **old and outdated**, with many issues like **repetition, inconsistency, low security**, and more.
- DBMS solves all these problems using **smart tools and techniques**.
- That‚Äôs why most modern systems like banks, schools, hospitals use **DBMS** instead of file systems.

---

## üìò **Database System Concept and Architecture**

**2021‚Äì22 Q1:** What is logical data independence?

### üîπ **Definition:**

A **Database System** is a combination of a **database** (organized collection of data) and a **DBMS** (software to manage it). It helps users store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently without needing to know the internal details of how the data is stored.

## üîπ **Architecture:**

### ‚úÖ **Why is Database Architecture Important?**

- Helps in **understanding the flow of data** from users to storage.
- Allows **multiple users** to work with the database at the same time safely.
- **Separates concerns**, so users don‚Äôt have to deal with how data is physically stored.
- Ensures **data security, performance, and maintainability**.

---

### üß± **Types of Database Architecture**

There are three main types of architecture:

#### 1. **1-Tier Architecture (Single Tier)**

- In 1-Tier Architecture the database is directly available to the user, the user can directly sit on the DBMS and use it that is, the client, server, and Database are all present on the same machine. This setup is simple and is often used in personal or standalone applications where the user interacts directly with the database.
- Best for **personal or small-scale applications**.

**Example:**  
MS Access on a personal computer.

**Features:**

- Simple and easy to use.
- No network involved.
- Not suitable for multiple users.

##### ![1-Tier Architecture](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230509110722/DBMS-1-Tier-Architecture-660.webp)

##### Advantages of 1-Tier Architecture

1-Tier Architecture offers several benefits, making it suitable for small-scale applications. Below are its key advantages:

- **Simple Architecture:**  
  It is the simplest architecture to set up, as it requires only a single machine to maintain.

- **Cost-Effective:**  
  No additional hardware is needed for implementation, making it a budget-friendly option.

- **Easy to Implement:**  
  Deployment is straightforward, which is why it is commonly used in small projects.

---

#### 2. **2-Tier Architecture (Client-Server)**

The **2-tier architecture** is a basic client-server model where the application at the client end directly communicates with the database on the server side. The server side is responsible for providing **query processing** and **transaction management** functionalities, while the client side runs the **user interfaces** and **application programs**. The client application establishes a connection with the server to interact with the DBMS.

##### **Example: Library Management System**

A **Library Management System** used in schools or small organizations is a classic example of two-tier architecture.

1. **Client Layer (Tier 1):**

- This is the **user interface** that library staff or users interact with. (Frontend)
- For example, they might use a desktop application to:
  - Search for books.
  - Issue books.
  - Check due dates.

2. **Database Layer (Tier 2):**

- The **database server** stores all the library records, such as: (Backend)
  - Book details.
  - User information.
  - Transaction logs.

**Features:**

- Better performance than 1-tier.
- Supports multiple users.
- Security and data integrity handled by the server.

##### ![2-Tier Architecture](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250108093805302915/2_tier.webp)

---

---

#### 3. **3-Tier Architecture (Widely Used in Real-World Applications)**

In **3-Tier Architecture**, there is an additional layer between the client and the server. The client does not directly communicate with the database server. Instead, it interacts with an **application server**, which acts as an intermediary. The application server processes the client‚Äôs requests, communicates with the database server, and returns the results to the client. This architecture is ideal for large-scale web applications.

##### **How It Works:**

1. **Client (Presentation Layer):**

- The user interacts with the system through a web browser, mobile app, or desktop application.
- Example: A user visits an online store, searches for a product, and adds it to their cart.

2. **Application Server (Business Logic Layer):**

- Processes the user‚Äôs request, applies business logic, and communicates with the database.
- Example: The system checks if the product is in stock, calculates the total price, and applies any discounts.

3. **Database Server (Data Layer):**

- Stores and retrieves data as requested by the application server.
- Example: The product details, user‚Äôs cart, and order history are stored in the database for future reference.

---

### **Example: E-Commerce Store**

- **User Interaction:**  
  A customer visits an online store, searches for a product, and adds it to their cart.

- **Processing:**  
  The application server validates the product‚Äôs availability, calculates the total price, and applies any discounts.

- **Database Interaction:**  
  The database stores the product details, cart information, and order history for future use.

---

### **Advantages of 3-Tier Architecture:**

- **Scalability:**  
  Each layer can be scaled independently to handle increased traffic or data.

- **Security:**  
  Sensitive data is protected as the client does not directly access the database.

- **Maintainability:**  
  Changes in one layer (e.g., UI updates) do not affect the other layers.

- **Performance:**  
  The application server can cache frequently accessed data, reducing the load on the database.

#### Important

## üß† **Three-Level Architecture (As per DBMS Concept)**

**2016‚Äì17 Q4, 2021‚Äì22 Q4, 2022‚Äì23 Q3:** What problems are associated with the three-schema architecture? / Discuss the three-level architecture of DBMS with a neat diagram. / Explain the ANSI/SPARC architecture in detail.

Apart from 1-tier, 2-tier, and 3-tier models, DBMS also follows a special **Three-Level Architecture** designed by ANSI/SPARC. It separates data into three views:

### üèûÔ∏è **External Level (View Level)**

The **External Level**, also known as the **View Level**, is the **topmost layer** of the **Three-Level DBMS Architecture**. It allows multiple users to access and view **specific data** tailored to their needs, without exposing the underlying database structure.

- **Purpose:**  
  Users interact with this level to retrieve data without needing to understand the database schema, table definitions, or internal storage details.  
  For example, a student might view their grades, while a teacher views attendance records ‚Äî both accessing the same database but seeing only the data relevant to them.

- **Key Features:**
  - Provides **customized views** of the database for different users.
  - Shields users from the complexities of the database schema.
  - Fetches data from the database (via the **Conceptual** and **Internal Levels**) and presents it in a user-friendly format.

---

### üß† **Conceptual Level (Logical Level)**

The **Conceptual Level**, also referred to as the **Logical Level**, defines the **overall structure and design** of the database. It focuses on the **logical relationships** between data, the **schema**, and the **constraints** applied to the data.

- **Purpose:**  
  This level is responsible for describing how data is organized and related, ensuring that the database is consistent and secure.

- **Key Features:**
  - Defines the **schema** (e.g., tables, relationships, and constraints).
  - Implements **security policies** and **database constraints**.
  - Managed by the **Database Administrator (DBA)** to ensure proper design and maintenance.

---

### üíæ **Internal Level (Physical Level)**

The **Internal Level**, also known as the **Physical Level**, is the **lowest layer** of the architecture. It deals with the **physical storage** of data on devices and manages how data is stored, retrieved, and allocated.

- **Purpose:**  
  This level ensures efficient storage and retrieval of data by defining how data is physically stored on disks or other storage devices.

- **Key Features:**
  - Describes the **physical storage structure** of the database.
  - Handles **space allocation** for data storage.
  - Optimizes data access and retrieval for performance.

---

### ‚ú® **Summary of the Three Levels**

| **Level**      | **Also Known As** | **Focus**                           | **Who Uses It**          |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **External**   | View Level        | User-specific views of data         | End Users                |
| **Conceptual** | Logical Level     | Logical design and relationships    | Database Designers (DBA) |
| **Internal**   | Physical Level    | Physical storage and data retrieval | Database Administrators  |

## üéØ **Why Use Three-Level Architecture?**

- **Data Independence:** Changes in storage or views don‚Äôt affect other levels.
- **Security:** Users can only access the data relevant to them.
- **Flexibility:** Easy to modify one level without disturbing others.

---

## üîÑ **Summary Table**

| **Level**        | **What it Represents**               | **Who Uses It**                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| External Level   | User-specific views of data          | End Users                      |
| Conceptual Level | Logical design of the whole database | Database Designers             |
| Internal Level   | Physical storage details             | Database Administrators (DBAs) |

# üìó **Data Model, Schema, and Instances**

**2016‚Äì17 Q2, 2021‚Äì22 Q5 & Q6, 2022‚Äì23 Q4:** Construct an ER diagram for a university registrar‚Äôs office. / Explain participation constraint in an ER diagram with a suitable example. / Draw an ER diagram based on given assumptions and convert it to a relational model. / Discuss different types of entities, attributes, and relations used in designing an ER diagram.

## üìò **What is a Data Model?**

A **Data Model** is a **way to describe how data is stored, organized, and connected** inside a database. It acts like a **map or design plan** for the database system. Just like a building needs a blueprint before construction, a database needs a data model before development.

---

### üîπ **Why is a Data Model Important?**

- It helps **design the structure** of the database.
- Makes it easy to **understand the relationships** between different types of data.
- Helps the **DBMS know how to store and retrieve** data efficiently.
- Ensures **data consistency, clarity, and integrity**.

---

## ‚úÖ **Main Features of a Data Model**

- **Structure of data** (e.g., tables, objects, nodes).
- **Data types** (like text, numbers, date, etc.).
- **Relationships** between data (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many).
- **Constraints** (like primary key, unique, not null, etc.).

---

## üîÑ **Types of Data Models (Simple + Detailed)**

### 1. **Hierarchical Data Model**

- Organizes data in a **tree-like structure**.
- One parent can have many children, but each child has only one parent.
- Best for **one-to-many** relationships.

**Example:**  
A company database where:

- One department has many employees.
- Each employee belongs to only one department.

```
Department
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Employee1
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Employee2
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Employee3
```

---

### 2. **Network Data Model**

- More flexible than hierarchical.
- A child can have **multiple parents** (many-to-many relationships).
- Uses **graph structure** with nodes and connections.

**Example:**  
A project management system where:

- Employees can work on **multiple projects**.
- A project can have **many employees**.

---

##### **\*\***

### 3. **Relational Data Model** (Most popular)

- Data is stored in **tables (called relations)**.
- Each table has **rows (records)** and **columns (fields)**.
- Tables can be connected using **keys** (Primary Key, Foreign Key).

**Example:**  
Student Table:
| ID | Name | Class |
|----|------|-------|
| 1 | Riya | 10 |
| 2 | Amit | 11 |

Marks Table:
| StudentID | Subject | Marks |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Math | 90 |
| 2 | Science | 85 |

---

### 4. **Object-Oriented Data Model**

- Combines the features of **object-oriented programming** and databases.
- Data is stored as **objects**, just like in programming (with properties and methods).

**Example:**  
A ‚ÄúCar‚Äù object can have:

- Attributes like: color, model, speed.
- Methods like: start(), stop().

Useful in applications where both **data and behavior** need to be stored together.

---

### üîπ **2. Schema**

**Definition:**  
A **schema** is the **overall structure/design** of the database ‚Äî like a blueprint.

**Example:**  
A student database schema might include tables like:

- Student (ID, Name, Class)
- Marks (StudentID, Subject, Score)

**Types of Schema:**

- **Physical Schema** ‚Äì How data is stored physically.
- **Logical Schema** ‚Äì The logical design (tables, relations, etc.).
- **View Schema** ‚Äì The part of the database shown to users.

---

### üîπ **3. Instances**

**Definition:**  
An **instance** is the **actual data** stored in the database at a particular moment.

**Example:**  
If a table `Student` has 3 rows today, that is the current instance. If you add or delete rows, the instance changes.

---

### ‚ú® In Summary:

## A **database system** allows data to be stored and accessed efficiently using a structured **architecture**. This structure includes different levels of views for users and administrators. Data is organized using a **data model**, designed by a **schema**, and filled with real-time **instances** (data values). All of these elements work together to keep the system flexible, efficient, and user-friendly.

## üìò **Data Definition Language (DDL)**

### üîπ **Definition:**

**Data Definition Language (DDL)** is a part of SQL that is used to **define and manage the structure** of database objects like tables, schemas, indexes, and views.

### üîπ **Key Points:**

- It is used to **create, alter, and delete** structures in the database.
- It doesn‚Äôt deal with the actual data ‚Äî only the **structure**.

### üîß **Common DDL Commands:**

| Command    | Use                                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `CREATE`   | To create a new table or database.                   |
| `ALTER`    | To modify an existing table (add/remove columns).    |
| `DROP`     | To delete a table or database.                       |
| `TRUNCATE` | To delete all data from a table (structure remains). |

### üß† **Example:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
   ID INT,
   Name VARCHAR(50),
   Class INT
);
```

---

## üìó **2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)**

### üîπ **Definition:**

**Data Manipulation Language (DML)** is used to **insert, update, delete, and retrieve** data in the database.

### üîπ **Key Points:**

- It works on the **data stored inside tables**.
- It allows users to **manipulate the data without changing the table structure**.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Common DML Commands:**

| Command  | Use                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `SELECT` | To retrieve data from one or more tables. |
| `INSERT` | To add new records into a table.          |
| `UPDATE` | To change existing data in a table.       |
| `DELETE` | To remove data from a table.              |

### üß† **Example:**

```sql
INSERT INTO Student (ID, Name, Class) VALUES (1, 'Riya', 10);
```

---

## üß± **3. Overall Database Structure**

### üîπ **Definition:**

The **Overall Database Structure** refers to the way the **database is organized**, including tables, schemas, relationships, and the way data is accessed, stored, and managed.

### üîπ **Key Elements of Database Structure:**

1. **Tables (Relations):**

   - The basic building blocks of a database.
   - Data is stored in **rows (records)** and **columns (fields)**.

2. **Schemas:**

   - A **schema** is the **design or layout** of the database.
   - It defines tables, fields, data types, constraints, relationships, etc.

3. **Keys:**

   - **Primary Key:** Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
   - **Foreign Key:** Links one table to another.

4. **Relationships:**

   - Define how tables are connected.
   - Types:
     - **One-to-One**
     - **One-to-Many**
     - **Many-to-Many**

5. **Indexes:**

   - Help **speed up data retrieval**.
   - Like an index in a book ‚Äî helps find data faster.

6. **Views:**
   - Virtual tables created by running a query.
   - Shows specific data from one or more tables without changing actual data.

Absolutely, Dev! Let‚Äôs properly define everything with clarity, structure, and examples from a **school system**. This will cover all important points related to **Entity**, **Entity Set**, **Logical Entity**, and **Physical Entity** in **DBMS**.

---

##### **Important\***

## üß† **1. Entity **

### ‚úÖ **_Definition:_**

An **entity** is a real-world object that is **distinct**, **uniquely identifiable**, because of it's features.

> In simple words, an entity is **"something" you can store information about** because it exists and is different from others.

### üè´ Example (School System):

- **Student** is an entity.
- Each student is different (has a unique ID, name, etc.).
- You store details like name, age, roll number, class, etc.

### üîë **Key Characteristics:**

- Must be **identifiable** (has a unique ID or property).
- Can be **physical** or **logical**.
- Has **attributes** (properties like name, age, etc.).

---

## üë• **2. Entity Set **

### ‚úÖ **Definition:**

An **Entity Set** is a **collection of similar entities** in a database.

> It is a **group of entities of the same type** that share the same attributes.

### üè´ Example:

- All students in a school = **Student Entity Set**
- All teachers = **Teacher Entity Set**
- All classrooms = **Classroom Entity Set**

> Just like "Class 10-A students" is a group, **entity set** is a group of similar entities.

---

## üß± **3. Types of Entities**

Entities are mainly classified into two types:

### A. **Physical Entity**

Entities that **exist physically** in the real world and can be touched or seen.

#### ‚úÖ Examples:

- **Student**
- **Teacher**
- **Classroom**
- **Library Books**

These are things you can physically interact with.

---

### B. **Logical Entity**

Entities that **exist logically**, meaning they are concepts or events, not physical objects.

#### ‚úÖ Examples:

- **Course**
- **Attendance Record**
- **Exam Result**
- **Fees Receipt**

You can‚Äôt "touch" an attendance record, but it‚Äôs real in the database. It's **logically stored and used**.

---

## üéØ Summary Points

| Concept             | Description                                         | Example (School System)     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Entity**          | A distinguishable object about which data is stored | Student, Teacher, Exam      |
| **Entity Set**      | Collection of similar type of entities              | All students = Student set  |
| **Physical Entity** | Entity with real-world physical existence           | Student, Teacher, Classroom |
| **Logical Entity**  | Entity with logical existence, not physical         | Result, Attendance, Course  |

---

## üè∑Ô∏è **Attributes in DBMS**

### ‚úÖ **Definition:**

An **attribute** is a **property or characteristic** of an entity that provides more information about it. Attributes define the **details** or **features** of an entity.

> In simple terms, attributes are the **columns** in a table that describe the **properties** of the rows (entities).

---

### üè´ **Example (School System):**

For the entity **Student**, the attributes could be:

- **Name** (e.g., John Doe)
- **Roll Number** (e.g., 101)
- **Class** (e.g., 10)
- **Date of Birth** (e.g., 2005-08-15)

---

## üîÑ **Types of Attributes**

Attributes can be classified into the following types:

##### **Important\***

### 1. **Simple vs Composite Attributes**

#### A. **Simple Attribute**

- A **simple attribute** is atomic cannot be divided further into smaller parts.
- It contains a **single value** that represents a property of the entity.

**Example:**

- For a **Student**:
  - `Roll Number` is a simple attribute.
  - `Class` is a simple attribute.

#### B. **Composite Attribute**

- A **composite attribute** can be divided into smaller sub-parts, each representing a more detailed property.

**Example:**

- For a **Student**:
  - `Full Name` can be divided into:
    - `First Name` (e.g., John)
    - `Last Name` (e.g., Doe)
  - `Address` can be divided into:
    - `Street` (e.g., 123 Main St)
    - `City` (e.g., New York)
    - `Zip Code` (e.g., 10001)

### 2. **Single-Valued vs Multi-Valued Attributes**

#### A. **Single-Valued Attribute**

- A **single-valued attribute** holds **only one value** for a particular entity.

**Example:**

- For a **Student**:
  - `Roll Number` is single-valued (e.g., 101).
  - `Date of Birth` is single-valued (e.g., 2005-08-15).

#### B. **Multi-Valued Attribute**

- A **multi-valued attribute** can hold **multiple values** for a particular entity.

**Example:**

- For a **Student**:
  - `Phone Numbers` can have multiple values (e.g., 123-456-7890, 987-654-3210).
  - `Subjects` can have multiple values (e.g., Math, Science, English).

---

### 3. **Stored vs Derived Attributes**

#### A. **Stored Attribute**

- A **stored attribute** is the one that is **physically stored** in the database.

**Example:**

- For a **Student**:
  - `Date of Birth` is a stored attribute (e.g., 2005-08-15).

#### B. **Derived Attribute**

- A **derived attribute** is **calculated** from other attributes and is **not stored** in the database.

**Example:**

- For a **Student**:
  - `Age` can be derived from the `Date of Birth` (e.g., Current Year - Birth Year).
  - `Total Marks` can be derived by summing up marks from all subjects.

## üß© **Relationship in DBMS**

### ‚úÖ **Definition:**

A **relationship** in DBMS is a **connection or association** between two or more entities. It shows how entities are related to each other in the real world.

### üè´ **Example (School System):**

- A **Student** is **enrolled in** a **Class**.
- A **Teacher** **teaches** a **Subject**.

Here, "enrolled in" and "teaches" are relationships between entities.

---

## üë• **Relationship Set**

### ‚úÖ **Definition:**

A **relationship set** is a **collection of similar relationships** between entities in a database.

### üè´ **Example:**

- If 30 students are enrolled in Class 10, then all these "enrolled in" connections form a **relationship set**.
- If 5 teachers teach different subjects, all these "teaches" connections form another **relationship set**.

---

## üî¢ **Degree of Relationship**

### ‚úÖ **Definition:**

The **degree of a relationship** refers to the **number of entities involved** in the relationship.

### üè´ **Types of Relationships:**

1. **Binary Relationship (Degree 2):**

   - A relationship between two entities.
   - **Example:** A **Student** is **enrolled in** a **Class**.

2. **Ternary Relationship (Degree 3):**

   - A relationship between three entities.
   - **Example:** A **Teacher** teaches a **Subject** to a **Class**.

3. **N-relationship**
   - A relationship betwenn N entities

| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Relationship**     | Connection between two or more entities.       | A Student is enrolled in a Class.                                             |
| **Relationship Set** | Collection of similar relationships.           | All "enrolled in" connections for students.                                   |
| **Degree**           | Number of entities involved in a relationship. | Binary: Student enrolled in Class; Ternary: Teacher teaches Subject to Class. |

## üîó **Mapping and Cardinality**

### ‚úÖ **What is Mapping?**

**Mapping** in DBMS refers to the **association or connection** between two entities in a relationship. It defines **how entities are related** and how many instances of one entity are associated with instances of another entity.

### üè´ **Example (School System):**

- A **Student** is **enrolled in** a **Class**.
- Mapping defines how many students can be in a class and how many classes a student can enroll in.

---

### ‚úÖ **What is Cardinality?**

**Cardinality** specifies the **number of instances** of one entity that can or must be associated with instances of another entity in a relationship.

### üè´ **Example:**

- A **Teacher** can teach **many Subjects**.
- A **Subject** can be taught by **one Teacher**.

---

## üî¢ **Types of Cardinality**

Cardinality is classified into three main types:

### 1. **One-to-One (1:1)**

- **Definition:** One instance of an entity is related to **exactly one instance** of another entity.
- **Example:**
  - A **Principal** manages **one School**, and that **School** has only one **Principal**.
- **Representation:**

  - `Principal <-> School`

  - `Principal 1 - 1 School`

---

### 2. **One-to-Many (1:N)**

- **Definition:** One instance of an entity is related to **many instances** of another entity.
- **Example:**
  - A **Teacher** teaches **many Students**, but each **Student** is taught by only one **Teacher**.
- **Representation:**

  - `Teacher <- Students`

  - `Teacher 1 - M Students`

---

### 3. **Many-to-Many (M:N)**

- **Definition:** Many instances of one entity are related to **many instances** of another entity.
- **Example:**
  - **Students** can enroll in **many Courses**, and each **Course** can have **many Students**.
- **Representation:**

  - `Students - Courses`

  - `Students N - M Courses`

---

## üéØ **Summary Table**

| **Cardinality Type**   | **Definition**                               | **Example (School System)**                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **One-to-One (1:1)**   | One entity instance relates to one other.    | A Principal manages one School.                  |
| **One-to-Many (1:N)**  | One entity instance relates to many others.  | A Teacher teaches many Students.                 |
| **Many-to-Many (M:N)** | Many entity instances relate to many others. | Students enroll in many Courses, and vice versa. |

### ‚ú® **Why is Cardinality Important?**

- Helps in **designing relationships** between entities.
- Ensures **data consistency** and avoids redundancy.
- Makes it easier to understand **real-world connections** in the database.
